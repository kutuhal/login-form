# login-form

###What it does?
It creates a simple login screen with basic validations:
* Login Name cannot be blank
* Password cannot be blank
* Only one submission is enable _(i.e. after clicking **Submit** button, **Submit** is disabled)_

###Why?
This was created to crystalize CSS & JavaScript learning on:
* Forms and Form validations using JavaScript  
* Disabling a button after submission
